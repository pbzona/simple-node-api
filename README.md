# To Do Tracker

This is a simple Node API that I'm building to figure stuff out. 

## Details

The server and API are written in NodeJS. The data storage is handled by MongoDB, and data is modeled with Mongoose. Tests are run with Mocha, and assertions are done with Expect with some help from Supertest.

## Miscellaneous

Will update as more stuff gets added.
