# To Do Tracker

This is a simple Node API that I'm building to figure stuff out. Lots of bad code will surely be included, and I'm hosting it in a public repo as a backup only. I guess what I'm saying is don't make fun of me :(

## Details

The server and API are written in NodeJS. The data storage is intended to be handled by a local MongoDB server, and data is modeled with Mongoose. Tests are run with Mocha, and assertions are done with Expect with some help from Supertest.

## Miscellaneous

Will update as more stuff gets added.
